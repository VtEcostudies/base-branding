                    	<p>
			The primary goal of the Vermont Atlas of Life is to make publicly available an exhaustive record of the biodiversity within the borders 
			of our state. As we embark on this effort, we feel an urgent need to recognize the entire human history of this region, and most importantly, 
			that history which white European colonists have ignored to this day: the history and knowledge of Indigenous People in Vermont.
			</p>
                    <h4 id="recog">
			<span id="recognition">Recognition</span></h4>
                    	<p>
			The land we identify as the State of Vermont is the traditional and unceded territory of the Abenaki people and the 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabanaki_Confederacy">Wabenaki Confederacy</a>. 
			Since ancient times, the Abenaki have been here, are still here, and will always live here. We pay our respects to them, and to the wisdom 
			of their elders and their culture. We recognize that this is their land.
			</p>
                    <h4 id="land">
			<span id="land_acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</span></h4>
                    	<p>
			The Vermont Center for Ecostudies is located on the western bank of the Kwanitekw (Connecticut River) in N’dakinna (Our Land) 
			in the ancient Abenaki Nation homeland which includes Vermont, New Hampshire, northern Massachusetts, western Maine, and southern Quebec.
			</p>
                    <h4 id="land">
			<span id="bands_tribes">Regional Bands and Tribes</span></h4>
			<p>
			We <u>acknowledge</u> these distinct tribes and bands that reside within the lands studied by the Vermont Atlas of Life:
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation is centered in Thetford and the surrounding area.</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missiquoi">Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi</a> is in northwest Vermont.</li>
			<li>The Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki is in northeast Vermont.</li>
			<li>The Elnu Abenaki Tribe is in southeast Vermont. This is the northern extent of their territory which extends into Massachusetts.</li>
			<li>The Mohicans <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/mohican/">extend into southwest Vermont from eastern New York and Massachusetts</a>, 
			where they border on the Abenaki Nation to the north and east.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
                    <h4 id="comm">
			<span id="community">Community</span></h4>
			<p>
			The Vermont Atlas of Life is a work in progress. Our hope and intent is that this project will continuously incorporate our evolving understanding 
			of the natural world and its history. We hope that, in gathering all that is known, we will include historical and present-day indigenous 
			knowledge of plants, animals and places, especially their names.
			</p>
			<p>
			We wish to bring all of Vermont’s communities together in this effort–to share, learn, and take stock of who we are, what lives here, and the 
			interrelationships of all living things in our state. We welcome and encourage your input–your knowledge, your ideas, your eyes, and your ears. 
			Please join us!
