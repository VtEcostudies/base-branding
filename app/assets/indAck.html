<p>
The land that we identify as the State of Vermont is the traditional and unceded territory of the Abenaki and Mohican people and the Wabanaki Confederacy. Since ancient times, the Abenaki have–and will always–live here. We pay our respects to them, and to the wisdom of their elders and their culture.
</p>
<p>
Long before European colonists arrived and claimed to discover Vermont’s native plants and animals, the Indigenous inhabitants of Vermont had intimate knowledge of what lived here. Just as many names of places reflect the original inhabitants of this land, so too the Abenaki and Mohicans have a rich linguistic tradition of names for the natural world - a native natural history.
</p>
<p>
The primary goal of the Vermont Atlas of Life (VAL) is to make publicly available an exhaustive record of the biodiversity within the borders of our state. The naming of things is a starting point for humanity’s awareness of the natural world. An important part of that record is missing from VAL: the history and knowledge of native plants and animals known to the Indigenous People of Vermont.
</p>
<p>
The Vermont Center for Ecostudies is located on the western bank of the Kwanitekw (Connecticut River). The Vermont Atlas of Life covers the biodiversity of Vermont, which is within N’dakinna (Our Land) in the ancient Abenaki Nation homeland which includes Vermont, New Hampshire, northern Massachusetts, western Maine, and southern Quebec.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation centered in Thetford, Newbury, and the surrounding area.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.abenakination.com/">Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi</a> in northwest Vermont.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://abenakitribe.org/">Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki</a> is in northeast Vermont.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://elnuabenakitribe.org/">Elnu Abenaki Tribe</a> in southeast Vermont.</li>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.mohican.com/">Mohicans</a> in southwest Vermont where they <a href="https://native-land.ca/maps/territories/mohican/">border on the Abenaki Nation to the north and east.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The Vermont Atlas of Life is a work in progress. Our hope and intent is that this project will continuously incorporate our evolving understanding of the natural world and its history. Following the work the Living Atlas of Australia has undertaken, we hope to partner with Indigenous groups to include their historical and present-day nomenclature and knowledge of plants, animals and places in VAL.
</p>
<p>
The Vermont Atlas of Life is a growing library of knowledge on Vermont’s animals, plants, and fungi – an online, real-time resource with maps, photographs, and data open for anyone to use. On this journey of discovery VAL has taken only the first few steps. We wish to bring all of Vermont’s communities together to share knowledge and discoveries, learn from each other, and work together to steward our shared natural heritage. Please join our growing community of knowledge-seekers at the Vermont Atlas of Life!
